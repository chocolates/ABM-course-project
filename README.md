# ABM-course-project
2016 spring, with Mike Yip
Inspired by language competition between Mandarin and Cantonese (two Chinese languages), we want to simulate the languages compete in a bilingual society and see when one language would extinct. More specifically, we place agents in different kinds of social networks with different parameters and observe when two language could coexist. Finally, we find that community structure is very helpful language co-existence.
